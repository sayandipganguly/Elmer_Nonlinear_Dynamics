Purpose

This program allows users to perform variaous types of nonlinear forced vibration analysis using Elmer. Also using the matlab code of Poincare' map users can be benifitted in the different field of application. Here an example of a cantilever beam is given with a focus on the application in structural health monitoring. The detailed results are provided in the article with title 'Performance assessment of time-domain damage indicators based on output-only measurement and Poincar√© map: A comparative review on nonlinear structures' with link https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2023.112847 .
